# InteractiveGamesUsingPython

This project demonstrates the use of Python programming by developing simple arcade games like Memory, Blackjack and Asteroids. Python is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language and comparitively is an easier choice for novice programmers.

To make our task easier, we used Codeskulptor built by Rice University (http://www.codeskulptor.org) as our primary platform for development. CodeSkulptor runs in Google Chrome 18+, Mozilla Firefox 11+, and Apple Safari 6+. Some features may work in other browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, but do not expect full functionality. CodeSkulptor is a browser-based Python interpreter and implements a subset of Python 2.6, plus the addition of a graphical user interface library, simplegui. SimpleGUI is a custom Python graphical user interface (GUI) module implemented directly in CodeSkulptor that provides an easy to learn interface for building interactive programs in Python.
