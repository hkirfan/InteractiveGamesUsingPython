<center><h3>Memory</h3></center><p>

<em>Memory</em> is a card game where cards are laid out in a grid face down,
and players take turns flipping pairs of cards over.  On each turn, the player
will first turn one card over, then a second.  If the two cards match, the
player scores one point, the two cards are removed from the game, and the
player gets another turn.  If they do not match, the cards are turned
back over.<p>

The object is to match all the pairs of cards in minimum number of moves. When cards are turned over, it
is important to remember where they are for when the matching card is turned
up later in the game.<p>

In this version of memory, there are eight unique pairs of cards,
making 16 cards total.<p>

<center><h3>BlackJack</h3></center><p>

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. 
Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer, meaning that players compete against 
the dealer but not against any other players. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. 
The object of the game is to "beat the dealer", which can be done in a number of ways:<p>
<p>    
    >>>  Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;<p>
    >>>  Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or<p>
    >>>  Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.<p>

<p>The player or players are dealt an initial two-card hand and add together the value of their cards. 
Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count his 
or her own ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the 
card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a "hit", or taking an 
additional card. In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having 
the highest score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 (called "busting" or "going bust") 
results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than 21 if the dealer busts. 
If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called "soft", meaning that the player cannot go bust by 
taking an additional card; 11 plus the value of any other card will always be less than or equal to 21. 
Otherwise, the hand is "hard".<p>

<p>The dealer has to take hits until his or her cards total 17 or more points. 
(In some casinos, the dealer also hits on a "soft" 17—e.g., an initial ace and six.) Players win if they do 
not bust and have a total that is higher than the dealer's. The dealer loses if he or she busts or has a 
lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is 
called a "push", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand.<p>


<center><h3>Asteroids</h3></center><p>

The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate 
left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, 
it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust 
in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting.<p>

Objects wrap around screen edges – for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen 
reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction.The player starts with 3 lives, for every
destruction of an asteroid a score of 10 is added and for every collision of the airship with an asteroid a 
life is lost. When the player loses all his lives, the game ends.<p>
